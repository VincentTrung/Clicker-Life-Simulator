#Drawings used for animations were from OpenGameArt.org
#Edited/altered with Google Drawings


Welcome to my simple program

This is my game used to represent life of a developer starting at age 17.

The Title just inludes two animations that will constantly run in the background of a typical grass/sky format.

The user will be presented with a title and two buttons to either start the game loop, or quit the program alltogether.


Instructions:
left click one of the two buttons with the mouse
"start" to start the game loop
"quit" to end the program

Main Game interactions
"work" to get paid for spending the day and gain a little exp
"learn" spend your time learning a decent amount of exp
"Job Offer" change your occupation which will offer better exp and pay

Each click will count as one day and debt will be deducted if you have any at the end of the year
